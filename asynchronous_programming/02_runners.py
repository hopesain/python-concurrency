"""
This section is about runners from the asyncio library.
A runner is a function that runs an asynchronous function and returns the result.
In simple terms, it is something that starts and manages the event loop for your asynchronous code.
An event loop is the engine that drives async code â€” a runner is what gets the engine started, manages its life cycle, and stops it safely.

import asyncio

async def main():
    print("start")
    await asyncio.sleep(2) # Sleep for 2 seconds.
    print("end")

asyncio.run(main()) # This is the runner that starts the event loop and runs the main function.


### RUNNERS CONTEXT MANAGERS ###
"""
It is a manual way to manage the event loop's lifecycle using a context manager (With statement).
You can use it to run multiple tasks without having to create a new event loop each time.
